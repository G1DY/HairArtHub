# HairArtHub

This is an application that is used in performing booking services for a hair cut or hair make over. 

The aim of the project is to provide a way for small and medium enterprises to keep an order of the customers request and to maintain a chronological order of the service delivery. Moreover, it provides a record for a detailed information for the services offered by the corporation. 

Considering the application does not have a lot of complexity and scalability expectations. We chose to use simple technologies in implementation. 
For the frontend development we chose:
React for the app development as it is simple, reusable, scalable and suitable for both mobile and web development. The cross platform usability of the application enables it convinient in the time taken for development as well as debugging. Moroever, components reusability is such a keen thing in OOP and modern development. It offers a seamless integration with components. 
The backend technologies we used Python that is integrated with sqlite database using Flask as the development framework for handling the logic and views routes. This framework is suitable since it can handle a small application without worrying about the scalability issues. 

The app works by requesting a user for a username and password if they are not signed in. And if the user is not then they can sign up. This is a prerequisite for a user to interact with the system as it provides for a mechanism to store their user information and session.
